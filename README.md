Coursework
Current plan for database is to have two tables. Prime table is the important one and needs to be implemented first, will contain Lat/Long, *possibly* extra geocoding stuff, a "Notes" section and finally I'll add a user ID thing for user submitted ones. Second table is just a generic user table.

Please be careful with all of this stuff. Requests only cost like 70% of a penny but if something goes wrong and I get charged twenty quid I'll be displeased. 

Main thing for me to work on next is making to so requests don't re-geocode themselves every intiation, as that apparently costs far more and is causing my current request errors.
